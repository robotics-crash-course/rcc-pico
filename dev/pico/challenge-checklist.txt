Sensor Challenges 1 (sensor_challenges/sensorchallenges1.html)

LED
    - blinking led with a function (using sleep_ms())
Button
    - button calls blinking function 
    - button changes servo position
    - ★★ button indexes thru an array

Motor Characterization
    - Determine which motor is faster

Odometry
    - stop robot after moving forward 200 counts
    - travel 200 counts with a scale_factor to go semi-straight
    - confirm number of counts per rotation of wheel
    Keeping one wheel still:
        - measure number of counts for 360 degree rotation
        - measure number of counts for 90 degree rotation
    ★★★ writing functions:
        - right turn (based on counts)
        - left turn (based on counts)
        - go forward, input number of counts 

Lidar
    - rotate robot, stop when detect object
    - ★★★ put ^ in a function

Autonomous
    - drive forwards, stop when object detected (hit the brakes)
    - ★★ stay 20 cm from an object
    - ★★★ target acquired 

IMU data
    - measure angular velocity when spinning at full power
    - ★★★ intro to controls with desired angular velocity

Sensor Challenges 2 (sensor_challenges/sensorchallenges2.html)

Unit conversions:
    - Convert 1 meter to number of counts
    - ★★ write function that converts counts to meters
    Keeping one wheel still:
        - ★★ write function that converts arc length to meters
        - ★★ Make 90 degree turn using counts

Integrating Angle from Angular Velocity
- use integrator to stop after 90 degree turn

State Machine Challenges (sm_challenges/smchallenges.html)

- blink led using previous & current time
- ★★ Follow at a distance (with tolerance)
- ★★★ Target acquired (in a state machine)
- ★★★ Travel thru tunnel
- ★★★ Find 3 objects
